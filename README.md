**Idea**

Living in a foreign country, I am always craving for Vietnamese food, but it's not easy to find.
I only know some good sellers by the word-of-mouth or by Facebook groups. However, some of them are really far from my place.
Therefore I would like to build a website for sellers to promote their business and for buyers to easily find Vietnamese food, which is nearby.

**Website**

* Users can register as a buyer or a seller, which allows them to log in and log out. Then they can modify or delete their profile.

* As sellers, they can add, modify or delete their products.

* As buyers, they can browse through the website for their desired products, or sellers nearby.
