#### Description:

**Idea**
Living in a foreign country, I am always craving for Vietnamese food, but it's hard to find.
I only know some good sellers by the word-of-mouth or by Facebook groups. Moreover, some of them are really far from my place.
I wish there would be an online market for the sellers to promote themselves and for the buyers to find Vietnamese food more easily.

**Website**

* First of all, users can register as a buyer or a seller, which allows them to log in and log out.

* Second, as a seller, they can add their products (food and/or restaurant)

* Third, as a buyer, they can browse through the website for their desired product. They can look for any food/restaurant near their place or search by category/name.

* Last, as a buyer, they can add their comments/ reviews as reference for others.
